      <h3><u>Fiction</u>: Oryx & Crake (MaddAddam, #1) by Margaret Atwood</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <i>Oryx & Crake</i> was the most gripping stream-of-consciousness story I've read. It weaves between the present (a lush apocalyptic version of our world, overrun with genetically modified animals and a small population of a new humanoid species) and the past (how all of this came to be), which is still set far into the future of our world today. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The complexity of the narrative is impressive, and Atwood structures it beautifully. The world-building is equally detailed and intriguing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Filled with stark emotion and a bittersweet exploration of human nature, our interactions with each other and with our world, Oryx & Crake is a striking story that will draw you in and keep you entranced.
